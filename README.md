# Bioinspired Spatial Data

In the domain of AI & ML, images represent one of the most common and
widely investigated type of data. Regardless of the specific field they
belong to, images carry information hidden in their own spatial
correlation.

Well-established models like CNNs can be successfully employed to disclose
the relevant patterns that build such correlation.

The same idea can be applied to different data like **gene expression**, which
might not come in form of image but that nevertheless carry information
through an intrinsic spatial correlation.

Furthermore, as neuromorphic sensors have shown, this strategy can be even
improved by focusing on sparse events rather than on a continuous
exploitation of the whole amount of data.

In terms of software implementation, this translates into the adoption of
**neuro-inspired spiking CNNs**, able to achieve state-of-the-art results with
much smaller energy consumption.

# Usage
## PyTorch+SNNTorch: NNI experiments (local)
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements 
3. Move to `nni_configs` folder
4. Select the configuration file for the experiment you wish to perform, and then execute the following command: \
  ```nnictl create --config <config_file>.yml --port 5001```

## Keras+NengoDL: NNI experiments (local)
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Move to `src/nengo_conversion` folder
4. Execute the following comand: \
    ```nnictl create --config nni_snn_config.yml --port 5001```

# Test
In `test` folder there are notebooks to test the code, specifically Fast-Denser net search, all the NNI experiments performed in this project and then models evaluation for Pytorch+SNNTorch pipeline. Please download it and run it on Google Colab. \
**NOTE:** the results that comes out from Colab are slightly different in terms of accuracy and training time from the ones that come from experiments performed locally with a NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.
